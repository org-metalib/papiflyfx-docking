## Phase 1: Research

> read this folder in depth, understand how it works deeply, what it does and all its specificities. when that’s done,
> write a detailed report of your learnings and findings in research.md
 
> study the notification system in great details, understand the intricacies of it and write a detailed research.md
> document with everything there is to know about how notifications work

> go through the task scheduling flow, understand it deeply and look for potential bugs. there definitely are bugs in 
> the system as it sometimes runs tasks that should have been cancelled. keep researching the flow until you find all
> the bugs, don’t stop until all the bugs are found. when you’re done, write a detailed report of your findings in research.md

## Phase 2: Planning

> I want to build a new feature &lt;name and description> that extends the system to perform &lt;business outcome>.
> write a detailed plan.md document outlining how to implement this. include code snippets

> the list endpoint should support cursor-based pagination instead of offset. write a detailed plan.md for how to achieve
> this. read source files before suggesting changes, base the plan on the actual codebase
 
### The Annotation/Discussion

> I added a few notes to the document, address all the notes and update the document accordingly. don’t implement yet
 

### The Todo List

> add a detailed todo list to the plan, with all the phases and individual tasks necessary to complete the plan - don’t implement yet

## Phase 3: Implementation

> implement it all. when you’re done with a task or phase, mark it as completed in the plan document. do not stop until 
> all tasks and phases are completed. do not add unnecessary comments or jsdocs, do not use any or unknown types.
> continuously run typecheck to make sure you’re not introducing new issues.
