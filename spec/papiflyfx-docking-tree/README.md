# Docking Tree View

## Research & Planning

I need a research document for a new component papiflyfx-docking-tree. Read:
- spec/papiflyfx-docking-tree/docking-tree-applications.md
- spec/papiflyfx-docking-tree/docking-tree-features.md
Write a detailed report of your learnings, findings and ideas in spec/papiflyfx-docking-code-lang-plugin/research.md

Write a very detailed `spec/papiflyfx-docking-tree/plan.md` document outlining how to implement this. Include code snippets.

## Implementation
Implement everything specified by `spec/papiflyfx-docking-tree/plan.md`. when you’re done with a task or phase, mark it
as completed in the `spec/papiflyfx-docking-tree/plan.md` document.
Add new `spec/papiflyfx-docking-tree/progress.md` file to track your progress.
Do not stop until all tasks and phases are completed. Do not add unnecessary comments or javadocs, do not use any or unknown types.
Continuously run typecheck to make sure you’re not introducing new issues.
