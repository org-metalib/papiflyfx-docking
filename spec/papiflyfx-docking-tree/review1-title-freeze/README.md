## Copilot Plan

Problem
- Assess `papiflyfx-docking-tree` and describe what is required to add an option that freezes selected folders during navigation.

Approach
- Inspect tree navigation, selection, flattening, and rendering paths to identify extension points.
- Identify data-model and API changes needed to represent frozen folders.
- Outline controller/render/test/documentation work needed for a safe implementation.

Execution Notes
- Produce findings in `spec/papiflyfx-docking-tree/review1/title-lines.md`.
- Keep recommendations scoped to minimal, backward-compatible additions.
