## Research

What it takes to implement a collapsible node info, that shows some extra information about a node?
The info section could be a rich text (html formatted), table, or card/form.

Put your findings to spec/papiflyfx-docking-tree/review2-node-info/research.md

## Planning

Write a very detailed `spec/papiflyfx-docking-tree/review2-node-info/plan.md` document outlining how to implement
 spec/papiflyfx-docking-tree/review2-node-info/research.md. Include code snippets.
 We are going with Option B (full inline behavior). Do not include anything for the other options to the plan.
 Do not include compatibility requirement.

## Implementation

Implement everything specified by `spec/papiflyfx-docking-tree/review2-node-info/plan.md`.
When you’re done with a task or phase, mark it as completed in the `spec/papiflyfx-docking-tree/review2-node-info/plan.md` document.
Add new `spec/papiflyfx-docking-tree/review2-node-info/progress.md` file to track your progress.
Do not stop until all tasks and phases are completed. Do not add unnecessary comments or javadocs, do not use any or unknown types.
Continuously run typecheck to make sure you’re not introducing new issues.
