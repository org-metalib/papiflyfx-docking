# Docking Tree — Application Targets

`papiflyfx-docking-tree` is designed as a generic hierarchical explorer component and can be reused across multiple domains.

## Common Application Domains

### Software and platform tools
- IDE project explorer
- Dependency graph browser
- JSON/XML structure viewer
- Database schema navigator
- Object inspector

### Content and knowledge management
- File/folder directory browser
- Document outline navigator
- Wiki/category hierarchy explorer
- Digital asset folder trees

### Business and operations
- Organization hierarchy viewer
- Budget/work-breakdown explorer
- Product taxonomy browser
- Ticket/category hierarchy viewer

### Design and technical authoring
- Layer panel hierarchy
- Scene graph explorer
- Bill of materials structure
- Animation hierarchy browser

## Best Fit for the Current Implementation
- Large tree datasets requiring virtualization.
- Explorer-style layouts where icon + text rows are primary.
- Keyboard-driven navigation and quick in-place rename workflows.
- Internal reorder and external drop extension points.

## Scenarios That Need Extension Work
- Multi-column tree/table use cases.
- Built-in row action widgets (visibility/lock/toggle controls).
- Built-in search/filter and advanced query views.
- Accessibility-focused workflows requiring richer assistive support.
