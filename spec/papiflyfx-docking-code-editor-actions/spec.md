# PapiflyFX Code Editor Actions Specification

This document defines the keyboard and mouse action requirements for the `papiflyfx-docking-code` module, normalized from `spec/papiflyfx-docking-code-editor-actions/README.md`.

## 1. Objective

- Define a clear, testable command set for text editing interactions.
- Align behavior with common modern editor conventions (VS Code / Sublime style).
- Keep platform parity between Windows and macOS.
- Include page-level navigation and selection semantics for large-file workflows.
- Support macOS full-keyboard aliases for document boundaries (`Cmd+Home/End`).
- Provide deterministic caret blinking behavior tied to editor activity/focus.

## 2. Scope

### 2.1 In Scope

- Caret navigation and selection commands.
- Editing shortcuts (undo/redo, line actions, word actions).
- Multi-cursor and rectangular selection actions.
- Mouse click/drag gestures that affect editor state.

### 2.2 Out of Scope

- IDE semantic navigation (`go to definition`, symbol index).
- Custom keybinding UI.
- Language-server behavior and refactor actions.
- Workspace tab cycling shortcuts (`Ctrl/Cmd+PageUp/PageDown`).

## 3. Command Model

Platform modifiers:

| Logical Modifier | Windows | macOS |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Primary` | `Ctrl` | `Cmd` |
| `Word` | `Ctrl` | `Option` |
| `MultiCursor` | `Alt` | `Option` |

The editor should bind shortcuts to command IDs, then execute behavior by command ID (not by hardcoded key-branches only).

## 6. Behavioral Rules

- Shift-extended operations must preserve anchor stability.
- Multi-caret edits must be deterministic for overlapping carets/selections.
- Line operations act on complete line spans when selection exists.
- Word boundaries must be deterministic (`[A-Za-z0-9_]` word class baseline).
- Undo/redo should treat each line action as a single history step.
- Page move/select uses viewport-derived line deltas (`max(1, floor(viewportHeight / lineHeight))`).
- Scroll-only page commands must not move caret or selection anchors.
- On macOS, `Cmd+Home/End` and `Cmd+Up/Down` must execute the same document-boundary commands.
- Caret blinking resets to visible on caret/document interactions and only paints while editor focus is active.

## 7. Persistence Impact

Persistence `v2` is implemented (2026-02-20).  
`EditorStateData` now captures:

- primary caret position (`cursorLine`, `cursorColumn`),
- primary selection anchor (`anchorLine`, `anchorColumn`),
- secondary carets/selections (`secondaryCarets` list).

`v1` payload restore remains supported via migration defaults:
- anchor defaults to cursor,
- secondary carets default to empty.

Phase 6 hardening (2026-02-20) adds:
- bounded secondary-caret restore payloads (cap: 2048),
- folded-line payload sanitization (non-negative, deduplicated),
- deterministic duplicate filtering for restored secondary carets,
- disposal guards on input/scroll event handlers.

## 8. Acceptance Criteria

| ID | Criterion |
| --- | --- |
| AC-1 | Profile A behavior remains stable and fully tested in headless CI. |
| AC-2 | Profile B keyboard shortcuts behave correctly on Windows and macOS mappings. |
| AC-3 | Profile B mouse gestures for multi-caret and box selection are deterministic. |
| AC-4 | Undo/redo correctness is preserved after multi-caret and line operations. |
| AC-5 | Session save/restore remains backward-compatible (`v1`) and supports new action state (`v2`). |
| AC-6 | Hardening/performance regressions are covered: disposal/listener cleanup stays safe and benchmark thresholds remain green. |
| AC-7 | `Page Up`/`Page Down` move/select/scroll-only command semantics are deterministic and covered by keymap + integration tests. |
| AC-8 | macOS `Cmd+Home/End` aliases map to document-boundary commands with matching selection-extension behavior. |
| AC-9 | Caret blinking behavior is deterministic (toggle, reset-on-interaction, inactive hidden state) and covered by viewport tests. |

## 9. Verification Strategy

- Unit tests for word boundaries, line action semantics, and multi-caret normalization.
- JavaFX/TestFX integration tests for key/mouse gesture matrices.
- JavaFX/TestFX integration tests for page move/select and scroll-only behavior.
- Keymap unit tests for macOS `Cmd+Home/End` and `Shift+Cmd+Home/End` alias resolution.
- Viewport rendering tests for caret blink toggle/reset/inactive semantics.
- Docking integration tests for state round-trip and fallback order (adapter -> factory -> placeholder).
- Benchmark-tagged validation for large-file load, typing latency, scroll latency, multi-caret latency, and memory overhead.
