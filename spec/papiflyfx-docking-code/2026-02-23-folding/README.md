## Research

read this papiflyfx-docking-code module in depth, understand how it works deeply, what it does and all its specificities.
when that’s done, notice that the current implementation does not support a notion of folding although all lexers are
about the languages that support text blocks and nested text blocks.

Study the current lexer implementation and come up with ideas how to improve it to support folding.

Write a detailed report of your learnings and findings in research.md

## Planning

I want to build a new feature "folding" support that extends the system to give a use easier document navigation.
Read this document `spec/papiflyfx-docking-code/2026-02-23-folding/research.md` and write a detailed 
`spec/papiflyfx-docking-code/2026-02-23-folding/plan.md` document outlining how to implement this. Include code snippets.

---

add a detailed todo list to the plan, with all the phases and individual tasks necessary to complete the plan - don’t implement yet

## Implementation
implement it all. when you’re done with a task or phase, mark it as completed in the plan document. do not stop until
all tasks and phases are completed. do not add unnecessary comments or jsdocs, do not use any or unknown types.
continuously run typecheck to make sure you’re not introducing new issues.
