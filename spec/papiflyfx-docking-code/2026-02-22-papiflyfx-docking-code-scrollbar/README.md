## Prompt
The current implementation of the code editor does not support vertical and horizontal scrollbars.
Create a comprehensive design document to support this feature in spec/papiflyfx-docking-code-scrollbar/design-claude.md.
Start with the concept of the wrapped text feature and continue with scrollbars. I expect a text wrap flag intruduced.
With this flag set to true there is not horizontal scrollbar necessary and the support of the box selection feature should be turned off as well.
