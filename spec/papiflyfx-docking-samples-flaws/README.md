There is a number of flaws you can see when you look at the docking samples (papiflyfx-docking-samples).

* Docking samples:
  * When you drag a pane the target shifted. It seems that sample list pane that is not docked but its size docking
    framework takes into account.
* Code editor samples:
  * When you double click on a word it highlights a word with the shift. Same problem as above.
  * When you try to select a rectangular area it selects with the shift.

Investigate the problem and suggest a solution. Create a report with your findings as
